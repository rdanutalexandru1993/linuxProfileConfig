# FAQ
1. Will there be any updates? 
Yes. As this is something that I actively use for myself, whenever I will add something that I need you will also benefit from the addition

2. Can I copy this and use as I please and share it with my friends?
Of course. If you want to drop me a "Thank you!" that would be great, but if not, that's also fine.

3. What if I need something added to this? Can I request a change or an update?
If I have the time, I would be happy to help.
